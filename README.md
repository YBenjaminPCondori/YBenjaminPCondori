# Hi, I'm Benjamin ðŸ‘‹

I love creating programs with code, not necessarily just pressing buttons on a keyboard, although I don't mind playing the keyboard if you'd like! 
My first public contributions during university. Today, Iâ€™m focused on creating systems that bridge the gap between hardware and intelligent softwareâ€”whether thatâ€™s in embedded systems, edge AI, or open source.

### ðŸŽ¯ Current Project: Multi-Modal Occupancy Monitoring System using Conv1D and Naive Bayes Classifier Data Compression

**iSpy** is my final year capstone project, inspired by the research of Prof. Tatiana Kalganova and completed as part of the *Individual Project* module.

The system fuses time-series sensor data and thermal imagery to detect room occupancy with high accuracy, using lightweight machine learning models optimized for edge deployment.

### ðŸš€ Key Features:
- Multi-sensor fusion (temperature, gas, humidity, thermal IR)
- Conv1D CNN-based time-series analysis
- Infrared thermal camera integration
- Naive Bayes-based data compression pipeline
- Real-time occupancy detection and alerting
- Edge-optimized deployment (Raspberry Pi)
