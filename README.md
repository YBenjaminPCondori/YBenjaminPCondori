# Hi, I'm Benjamin ðŸ‘‹

I love creating programs with code, not necessarily just pressing buttons on a keyboard, although I don't mind playing the keyboard if you'd like! 
My first public contributions during university. Today, Iâ€™m focused on creating systems that bridge the gap between hardware and intelligent softwareâ€”whether thatâ€™s in embedded systems, edge AI, or open source.
